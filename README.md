Welcome to Public Transport Enabler, a Java library allowing you to get data from public transport providers.

This project contains several subprojects:

 * [__enabler__](enabler):
     The library itself. This is probably what you're searching for. See the subproject's [README](enabler/README.md) for more information.
 * [__service__](service):
     An example of how the library could be used as a web service. It's still incomplete though. If you want to test it, see the subproject's [README](service/README.md) for more information.

You can build all sub-projects at once using Gradle:

`gradle clean build`
